# About Me

I am a Miami-born, Philadelphia-based professional with a recent Master’s degree in Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) with a concentration in Affordable Housing & Policy from the University of Pennsylvania. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Florida and have diverse professional experience as a Landscape Designer II, Project Manager & Geospatial Analyst, Specimen Technician, and Chef. My unique background enables me to excel in collaborative, deadline-driven environments while effectively managing teams during high-pressure periods.

My passion lies in using data-driven design as a tool for social justice, particularly in promoting equitable urban green spaces and implementing green infrastructure. I am committed to leveraging spatial analysis, GIS, and data visualization to support community-driven design practices. I possess a robust skill set, including proficiency in advanced data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming in R and Python. Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to manage projects effectively, deliver insightful analyses, and excel in team-oriented environments with a focus on clear communication, time management, and a strong work ethic.

## Personal Interests

In my free time, I'm a musician and still an avid cook who loves to cook over an open fire. I have played in musical projects based in Gainesville, FL & Jamaica Plain, MA, including ***Kvetch***, ***Tiny Farm***, and ***Camp Hope***. I enjoy going on hikes with my dog **Ripley** and am a big sports fan, especially of Miami teams like the Heat, Panthers, and Dolphins.
