## Personal Interests

![Meet Ripley!](assets/ripley.png){width="406"}

In my free time, I'm a musician and still an avid cook who loves to cook over an open fire.
I have played in musical projects based in Gainesville, FL & Jamaica Plain, MA, including ***Kvetch***, ***Tiny Farm***, and ***Camp Hope***.
I enjoy taking hikes with my dog **Ripley** and am a big sports fan, especially of Miami teams like the Heat, Panthers, and Dolphins.
