# Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Public Policy Analytics course at UPENN. Emil City is considering a more proactive approach for targeting homeowners who qualify for a home repair tax credit program. This analysis aimed to train the best classifier to predict which homeowners are most likely to accept the credit and use the results to inform a cost/benefit analysis. By leveraging historical campaign data, we developed models to predict homeowners' likelihood of accepting the subsidy and conducted a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. The goal was to optimize resource allocation and increase participation in the credit program.
