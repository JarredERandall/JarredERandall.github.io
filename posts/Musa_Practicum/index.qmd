This project was completed as part of the Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) program practicum, where students collaborate with real-world clients to develop data science tools that help stakeholders better allocate their limited resources.

## The Challenge

Watauga County, located in a rural area of North Carolina, faces unique geographical and economic challenges in developing affordable housing. The limited wastewater sewage connections mean that septic permits are essential for new developments, adding a layer of complexity to site selection for housing projects.

```
## Our Solution

Our team, working closely with the Watauga Housing Council, developed a data-driven application leveraging advanced spatial analysis. We focused on identifying undeveloped parcels that mirrored the physical and spatial characteristics of parcels that had successfully obtained septic permits in the past.
