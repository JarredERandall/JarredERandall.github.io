# Project Overview 


These documents presents policy analysis and recommendation writing samples completed as part of my coursework at the University of Pennsylvania. These samples highlight my ability to analyze complex policy issues, formulate actionable recommendations, and communicate findings effectively to policymakers and stakeholders.
