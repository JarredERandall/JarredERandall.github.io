    "text": "I am a Miami-born, Philadelphia-based professional with a recent Master’s degree in Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) from the University of Pennsylvania, focusing on Affordable Housing & Policy. With a strong foundation in data analysis, project management, and cross-functional team leadership, I bring diverse professional experience as a Technical Project Manager, Geospatial Analyst, and Landscape Designer.\nThroughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to manage projects effectively, deliver insightful analyses, and excel in team-oriented environments with a focus on clear communication, time management, and a strong work ethic. My passion lies in leveraging data and technology to deliver impactful solutions, with a strong emphasis on collaboration, process optimization, and operational efficiency.\nI possess a robust skill set that includes project management, advanced data analysis, and technical proficiency in R, Python, and GIS. I am committed to using these skills to drive successful project execution, improve business processes, and deliver results that align with strategic goals.\n\n\n\nLed Cross-Functional Projects and Teams: Managed multiple complex projects from initiation through delivery, ensuring successful and timely execution by leading teams and coordinating across departments.\nData-Driven Project Planning: Utilized data analysis and spatial modeling to provide actionable insights for effective project planning, ensuring projects align with client goals and regulatory standards.\nStakeholder and Client Collaboration: Facilitated clear and consistent communication with stakeholders, ensuring alignment on project scope, progress, and outcomes. Adjusted project approaches based on stakeholder feedback and data-driven insights.\nTechnical Leadership in Finance and Operations Projects: Worked as part of multidisciplinary teams to implement and improve systems, ensuring compliance, data accuracy, and operational efficiency.\nProcess Improvement and Compliance: Developed comprehensive project documentation, frameworks, and governance processes to ensure regulatory compliance and support effective decision-making.\nProduced high-quality graphic exhibits, renderings, and data visualizations: Communicated design concepts and analytical insights effectively to clients and stakeholders, using data visualization tools to translate complex statistical data into actionable insights.\nConducted survey fieldwork and data collection: Gathered essential data for project planning and spatial analysis, contributing to informed and accurate design decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Project Management: Effective in leading projects from conception to completion with a focus on data-driven decision-making.\nCreative Thinking and Problem Solving:: Adept at generating innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges in both design and analysis.\nAdvanced Data Analysis, Modeling, and Visualization: Proficient in using R, Python, and GIS for spatial analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization to inform decision-making.\nStakeholder Engagement and Leadership: Skilled in building relationships across functions to facilitate collaboration, ensure stakeholder alignment, and drive successful project outcomes.\nAnalytical Problem Solving: Strong ability to identify challenges, generate innovative solutions, and drive projects toward successful outcomes.\nCross-Functional Collaboration: Thrive in collaborative environments, effectively managing communication between teams, stakeholders, and clients.\n\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I’m a musician and still an avid cook who loves to cook over an open fire. I have played in musical projects based in Gainesville, FL & Jamaica Plain, MA, including Kvetch, Tiny Farm, and Camp Hope. I enjoy going on hikes with my dog Ripley and am a big sports fan, especially of Miami teams like the Heat, Panthers, and Dolphins.\n\n\n\nMeet Ripley!"
