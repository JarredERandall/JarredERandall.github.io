    "text": "I am a Miami-born, Philadelphia-based professional with a recent Master’s degree in Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) with a concentration in Affordable Housing & Policy from the University of Pennsylvania. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Florida and have diverse professional experience as a Landscape Designer II, Project Manager & Geospatial Analyst, Specimen Technician, and Chef. My unique background enables me to excel in collaborative, deadline-driven environments while effectively managing teams during high-pressure periods.\nMy passion lies in using data-driven design as a tool for social justice, particularly in promoting equitable urban green spaces and implementing green infrastructure. I am committed to leveraging spatial analysis, GIS, and data visualization to support community-driven design practices. I possess a robust skill set, including proficiency in advanced data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming in R and Python. Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to manage projects effectively, deliver insightful analyses, and excel in team-oriented environments with a focus on clear communication, time management, and a strong work ethic.\n\n\n\nLed diverse landscape design and analytical projects: Demonstrated strong project management and analytical skills, ensuring timely and successful project completion with data-driven insights.\nConducted in-depth proposal research: Resulted in a higher project win rate and improved decision-making by providing detailed and compelling data analyses and project proposals.\nCreated innovative conceptual designs and analytical models: Met client specifications and exceeded expectations through creativity, attention to detail, and the application of rigorous statistical models for predictive analysis and scenario planning.\nDeveloped comprehensive construction documents and data frameworks: Ensured accurate plans for implementation and established robust frameworks for spatial data analysis and statistical evaluation, enhancing project accuracy and reliability.\nCoordinated with regulatory agencies: Ensured project compliance and smooth approval processes by liaising effectively with relevant authorities.\nProduced high-quality graphic exhibits, renderings, and data visualizations: Communicated design concepts and analytical insights effectively to clients and stakeholders, using data visualization tools to translate complex statistical data into actionable insights.\nConducted survey fieldwork and data collection: Gathered essential data for project planning and spatial analysis, contributing to informed and accurate design decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Management & Leadership: Effective in leading projects from conception to completion with a focus on data-driven decision-making.\nCreative Thinking and Problem Solving:: Adept at generating innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges in both design and analysis.\nResearch and Data Analysis: Proficient in conducting thorough research and applying advanced statistical techniques for data-driven insights.\nAdvanced Data Analysis, Visualization, and Management: Skilled in utilizing advanced techniques for data analysis, spatial modeling, and visualization using R, Python, and GIS.\nData-Driven Design and Analysis: Expertise in applying spatial analysis and statistical modeling to inform design and operational decisions.\nCollaboration: Thrive in collaborative work environments, working effectively with teams, stakeholders, and clients.\n\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I’m a musician and still an avid cook who loves to cook over an open fire. I have played in musical projects based in Gainesville, FL & Jamaica Plain, MA, including Kvetch, Tiny Farm, and Camp Hope. I enjoy going on hikes with my dog Ripley and am a big sports fan, especially of Miami teams like the Heat, Panthers, and Dolphins.\n\n\n\nMeet Ripley!"
