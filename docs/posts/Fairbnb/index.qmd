## Project Overview

This study examines the impact of overtourism in Amsterdam and explores data-driven strategies for managing short-term rentals. The project focuses on the implementation and outcomes of regulatory measures, and the role of the Fairbnb app in ensuring compliance and promoting fair rental practices.

This project was completed as part of the Public Policy Analytics course at UPENN, where students analyze real-world issues using data science tools. My partner, Nohman Akharti, and I collaborated to deliver comprehensive insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by Amsterdamâ€™s tourist boom. By leveraging a variety of data sources, including Airbnb activity, housing market trends, and regulatory impacts, we developed models to predict the effects of different policy measures on local housing and tourism dynamics.
